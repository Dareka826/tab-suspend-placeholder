# Tab Suspend Placeholder

A Firefox add-on that replaces tabs with a placeholder that doesn't have any background tasks. It displays the page title, url and optionally an image.

You can add a custom image (e.g. a page screenshot by setting the suspended page's `url` parameter to a `data:image` url)
